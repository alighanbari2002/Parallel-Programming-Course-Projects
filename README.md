# Parallel Programming Course Projects

## Overview
This repository contains projects from a parallel programming course, focusing on data-level, thread-level, and instruction-level parallelism. The projects explore parallelization techniques using SIMD SSE3, OMP, and POSIX threads, with an emphasis on utilizing Intel Parallel Studio for hotspot analysis and code parallelization.
